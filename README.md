# Personal Blog

## Description
This blog showcases the skill of linking three coding components: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**. Not only does creating content on one page transfer to a second page (by submitting a form), but there is a lightswitch element on both pages as well as a back button on the second page of the blog. These features prove the importance and versitality of Javascript!

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (version ES6+)

## Usage
In the first page of the blog, there is a form for the user to fill out personal information as well as what content they want to include in their blog post. Once submitted, the form content is pushed to local storage and pulled from local storage into the second page of the blog. Because it is pulled from local storage, the user is able to see the content they submitted in a neat format. If the user wishes to submit another post, they can click the back button and fill out the form again.
